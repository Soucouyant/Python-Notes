# Numbers 
# Two types of numbers in python, integers and floats

## Integers
int = 2
print(int);

## Floats
## Notation Type 1: Standard Declaration
float = 2.2
print(float)
## Notation Type 2: float method [float is not callable on MAC]
# float2 = float(2)
# print(float2)

# Strings
## Single Quote vs Double Quote
## Double Quotes "" allow for apostrophes to be easier to implement
myString = "I can't believe..."
print(myString)

## String concatenation
String1 = "Hello,"
String2 = "World"
print(String1 + " " + String2)

# Simultaneous Declarations
x, y = 1, 2
print(x,y)

# Note that you cannot mix types
# Ex.
# String1, String2 = "Hello", "World"
# one = 1
# print(String1 + String2 + one)
# ^ This print statement would result in an error
